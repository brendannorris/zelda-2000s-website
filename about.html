        Hi there! I'm a traveler from the Kokiri Forest (not really). When I'm
        not busy smashing pots for rupees, I'm exploring new dungeons (in
        code) and enjoying retro aesthetics. Feel free to poke around my site to
        learn more.

        I started playing <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> when I was a wee lad.
        My favorite game in the series is <strong>Ocarina of Time</strong>.
        But I also love to chat about the classic SNES hits and even indulge in
        modern re-releases.
